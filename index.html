                    <p>Healthcare services have experienced significant disruptions and backlogs as
                        a result of the COVID-19 pandemic all over the world, including the United States.</p>
                    <p>Like many other segments of the population, women are bearing the impact of
                        these disruptions in significant ways.</p>
                    <p>Particularly non-emergency services, such as regular gynecological check-ups,
                        testing and screening for sexually transmitted infections and breast cancer, and elective
                        procedures, have been <b><u>significantly delayed</u></b>.</p>
                        <p><b>These delays have left millions of women across the United States without
                            primary care and routine immunization. This has, in turn, increased the risk of common
                            infections and noncommunicable diseases in women. </b></p>
                    <p>According to a survey done by the World Health Organization in 21 African countries following
                        the pandemic, it was found that [3];</p>

                            the pandemic</li>
                        <li>Poverty rates have increased from <b>11.7% to 12.5%</b> in just two years</li>
    
                    </ul>

                        and reduced sports activities have also led to this issue, particularly in females.

                        due to fear of getting COVID-19.

                        While it's true that In response to the pandemic, many health organizations advised people to
                        maintain physical distance and avoid shaking hands as a precautionary measure, it is important
                        to note that they should not become a routine practice and a way to show discrimination.

                        We should try to strike a balance between caution and normalcy so that people won't be affected
                        by our behavior and still be able to interact in meaningful ways.</p>

                    <p>These stigmas are mainly a result of inaccurate or false information about COVID-19 circulating

                <p>HCPSC offers regular cervical and breast cancer detection and screening for women. The
                    procedures involved include;</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cervical cytology (Pap test)</li>

                <p>There have been delays and disruptions in the United States in providing care for breast cancer
                    patients due to the pandemic. A number of cases have been reported in which women feel hesitant to
                    visit a healthcare facility for screenings due to fear of getting the infection.</p>
                <p>At HCPSC, you can also avail the facility of telemedicine and virtual visits to a gynecologist to

                <h3>Family Planning</h3>
                <p>The use of contraceptives has significantly changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is mainly true
                    for hormonal contraceptives for women that are accessible only with a prescription as well as
                    implant and intrauterine contraceptive devices [8].</p>
                <p>If you want to book a face-to-face contraceptive consultation or discuss your preferred choice of
                    family planning with a specialist, visit HCPSC.</p>
                <p>It is particularly important to consult a healthcare professional for family planning if you have had
                    a baby in the last six months and also have an underlying health condition, such as diabetes or

                    </h3>
                    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to light the importance of comprehensive maternity services for

                    <p>In addition to quality prenatal care, safe delivery facilities must also be made available to

                    </p>
                    <p>At HCPSC, the specialized maternity services also include screening for COVID-19 and continuous

                    </h3>
                    <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported that mothers who have recently
                        given birth are at a particularly high risk of experiencing severe complications from COVID-19
                        [9].</p>
                    <p>In order to protect themselves from getting sick, mothers must receive extensive and high-quality
                        postpartum care.</p>

                        to an ICU, or put on a ventilator. Being older than 25 years, having an underlying health
                        condition like diabetes, and being Hispanic or Black [2] may increase your risk of getting
                        severely ill from COVID-19. </p>

                <strong>Final Thoughts</strong>
            </h5>
            <p>The pandemic has led to the postponement or cancellation of routine and emergency medical procedures,
                leading to delayed diagnoses and treatment.</p>
            <p>It has particularly been challenging for women as they have difficulty accessing quality and timely
                healthcare. Delayed prenatal and postnatal care have had severe consequences for both mother and child.
            </p>
            <p>Additionally, the pandemic has had a disproportionate economic impact on women, many of whom work in
                healthcare or other essential industries, increasing the burden of the pandemic on their physical and
                mental health.</p>
            <p>As the world continues to grapple with the effects of COVID-19, it is crucial to prioritize the provision
                of essential health services for women and ensure that they receive the care they need to maintain their
                health and well-being.</p>
            <p>If you're a woman struggling with a health issue after being diagnosed with COVID-19, contact a
                specialist immediately.
